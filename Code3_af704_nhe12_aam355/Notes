1. Summing the belief matrix in a for loop gives us a slightly innacurate value
2. Should we round And if so to how many decimal places?
3. Difference between distance traveled and number of searches (is distance traveled = manhattan distance from starting point to target?)
4. What is the difference between the formula for question 1 and 2
5. How do you update the belief state in agent 2 (our idea is to create a new matrix and incorporate FNR into it)
